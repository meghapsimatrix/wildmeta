	title = {Bootstrap-{Based} {Improvements} for {Inference} with {Clustered} {Errors}},
	abstract = {Researchers have increasingly realized the need to account for within-group dependence in estimating standard errors of regression parameter estimates. The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (ﬁve to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic reﬁnement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duﬂo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},

	abstract = {The wild bootstrap is studied in the context of regression models with heteroskedastic disturbances. We show that, in one very specific case, perfect bootstrap inference is possible, and a substantial reduction in the error in the rejection probability of a bootstrap test is available much more generally. However, the version of the wild bootstrap with this desirable property is without the skewness correction afforded by the currently most popular version of the wild bootstrap. Simulation experiments show that this does not prevent the preferred version from having the smallest error in rejection probability in small and medium-sized samples.},

	abstract = {The cluster robust variance estimator (CRVE) relies on the number of clusters being sufﬁciently large. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the ‘rule of 42’ is not true for unbalanced clusters. Rejection frequencies are higher for datasets with 50 clusters proportional to US state populations than with 50 balanced clusters. Using critical values based on the wild cluster bootstrap performs much better. However, this procedure fails when a small number of clusters is treated. We explain why CRVE t statistics and the wild bootstrap fail in this case, study the ‘effective number’ of clusters and simulate placebo laws with dummy variable regressors.
