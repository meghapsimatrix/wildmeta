  abstract = {It is well known that the standard F test is severely affected by heteroskedasticity in unbalanced analysis of covariance models. Currently available potential remedies for such a scenario are based on heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimation (HCCME). However, the HCCME approach tends to be liberal in small samples. Therefore, in the present paper, we propose a combination of HCCME and a wild bootstrap technique, with the aim of improving the small-sample performance. We precisely state a set of assumptions for the general analysis of covariance model and discuss their practical interpretation in detail, since this issue may have been somewhat neglected in applied research so far. We prove that these assumptions are sufficient to ensure the asymptotic validity of the combined HCCME-wild bootstrap analysis of covariance. The results of our simulation study indicate that our proposed test remedies the problems of the analysis of covariance F test and its heteroskedasticity-consistent alternatives in small to moderate sample size scenarios. Our test only requires very mild conditions, thus being applicable in a broad range of real-life settings, as illustrated by the detailed discussion of a dataset from preclinical research on spinal cord injury. Our proposed method is ready-to-use and allows for valid hypothesis testing in frequently encountered settings (e.g., comparing group means while adjusting for baseline measurements in a randomized controlled clinical trial).},

The authors found that all studies, regardless of type, had design ﬂaws. However, both within and across design types, there was generally consistent evidence for a positive inﬂuence of homework on achievement. Studies that reported simple homework–achievement correlations revealed evidence that a stronger correlation existed (a) in Grades 7–12 than in K–6 and (b) when students rather than parents reported time on homework. No strong evidence was found for an association between the homework–achievement link and the outcome measure (grades as opposed to standardized tests) or the subject matter (reading as opposed to math). On the basis of these results and others, the authors suggest future research.},

A prominent idea suggests that training self-control by repeatedly overriding dominant responses should lead to broad improvements in self-control over time. Here, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis based on robust variance estimation of the published and unpublished literature on self-control training effects. Results based on 33 studies and 158 effect sizes revealed a small-to-medium effect of g = 0.30, confidence interval (CI95) [0.17, 0.42]. Moderator analyses found that training effects tended to be larger for (a) self-control stamina rather than strength, (b) studies with inactive compared to active control groups, (c) males than females, and (d) when proponents of the strength model of self-control were (co)authors of a study. Bias-correction techniques suggested the presence of small-study effects and/or publication bias and arrived at smaller effect size estimates (range: gcorrected = .13 to .24). The mechanisms underlying the effect are poorly understood. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the repeated control of dominant responses is the critical element driving training effects.},

Controlling for several issues, including publication selection bias, while our preferred baseline income elasticity estimate of 1.186 is consistent with air travel being a luxury and a slightly immature market, there are several features of the literature which sway the income elasticity away from this baseline. For instance, the income elasticity increases to 1.546 on international routes, yet decreases to 0.633 when air fare is included in a dynamic speciﬁcation of demand, ceteris paribus. Other characteristics of the literature, such as those involving various data and estimation choices, have less inﬂuence on the reported income elasticity.},

	abstract = {This article examines the empirical support for the hypothesized hedonic theoretical relation between the price of wine and its quality. The examination considers over 180 hedonic wine price models developed over 20 years, covering many countries. The research identiﬁes that the relation between the price of wine and its sensory quality rating is a moderate partial correlation of +0.30. This correlation exists despite the lack of information held by consumers about a wine’s quality and the inconsistency of expert tasters when evaluating wines. The results identify a moderate price-quality correlation, which suggests the existence of strategic buying opportunities for better informed consumers. Strategic price setting possibilities may also exist for wine producers given the incomplete quality information held by consumers. The results from the meta-regression analysis point to the absence of any publication bias, and attribute the observed asymmetry in estimates to study heterogeneity. The analysis suggests the observed heterogeneity is explained by the importance of a wine’s reputation, the use of the 100-point quality rating scale, the analysis of a single wine variety/style, and the employed functional form. The most important implication from the analysis is the relative importance of a wine’s reputation over its sensory quality, inferring that producers need to sustain the sensory quality of a wine over time to extract appropriate returns. The reputation of the wine producer is found not to inﬂuence the strength of the pricequality relationship. This ﬁnding does not contradict the importance of wine producer reputation in directly inﬂuencing prices.},

	abstract = {Multivariate meta-analysis allows the joint synthesis of summary estimates from multiple end points and accounts for their within-study and between-study correlation. Yet practitioners usually meta-analyse each end point independently. I examine the role of within-study correlation in multivariate meta-analysis, to elicit the consequences of ignoring it. Using analytic reasoning and a simulation study, the within-study correlation is shown to inﬂuence the ‘borrowing of strength’ across end points, and wrongly ignoring it gives meta-analysis results with generally inferior statistical properties; for example, on average it increases the mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates, and for non-ignorable missing data it increases their bias. The inﬂuence of within-study correlation is only negligible when the within-study variation is small relative to the between-study variation, or when very small differences exist across studies in the within-study covariance matrices.The ﬁndings are demonstrated by applied examples within medicine, dentistry and education. Meta-analysts are thus encouraged to account for the correlation between end points. To facilitate this, I conclude by reviewing options for multivariate meta-analysis when within-study correlations are unknown; these include obtaining individual patient data, using external information, performing sensitivity analyses and using alternatively parameterized models.},

	abstract = {The wild bootstrap is studied in the context of regression models with heteroskedastic disturbances. We show that, in one very specific case, perfect bootstrap inference is possible, and a substantial reduction in the error in the rejection probability of a bootstrap test is available much more generally. However, the version of the wild bootstrap with this desirable property is without the skewness correction afforded by the currently most popular version of the wild bootstrap. Simulation experiments show that this does not prevent the preferred version from having the smallest error in rejection probability in small and medium-sized samples.},

	abstract = {The cluster robust variance estimator (CRVE) relies on the number of clusters being sufﬁciently large. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the ‘rule of 42’ is not true for unbalanced clusters. Rejection frequencies are higher for datasets with 50 clusters proportional to US state populations than with 50 balanced clusters. Using critical values based on the wild cluster bootstrap performs much better. However, this procedure fails when a small number of clusters is treated. We explain why CRVE t statistics and the wild bootstrap fail in this case, study the ‘effective number’ of clusters and simulate placebo laws with dummy variable regressors.

  journal = {Prevention Science},
  issn = {1573-6695},
  abstract = {In prevention science and related fields, large meta-analyses are common, and these analyses often involve dependent effect size estimates. Robust variance estimation (RVE) methods provide a way to include all dependent effect sizes in a single meta-regression model, even when the exact form of the dependence is unknown. RVE uses a working model of the dependence structure, but the two currently available working models are limited to each describing a single type of dependence. Drawing on flexible tools from multilevel and multivariate meta-analysis, this paper describes an expanded range of working models, along with accompanying estimation methods, which offer potential benefits in terms of better capturing the types of data structures that occur in practice and, under some circumstances, improving the efficiency of meta-regression estimates. We describe how the methods can be implemented using existing software (the ``metafor'' and ``clubSandwich'' packages for R), illustrate the proposed approach in a meta-analysis of randomized trials on the effects of brief alcohol interventions for adolescents and young adults, and report findings from a simulation study evaluating the performance of the new methods.}

  abstract = {Standard methods for meta-analysis are limited to pooling tasks in which a single effect size is estimated from a set of independent studies. However, this setting can be too restrictive for modern meta-analytical applications. In this contribution, we illustrate a general framework for meta-analysis based on linear mixed-effects models, where potentially complex patterns of effect sizes are modeled through an extended and flexible structure of fixed and random terms. This definition includes, as special cases, a variety of meta-analytical models that have been separately proposed in the literature, such as multivariate, network, multilevel, dose-response, and longitudinal meta-analysis and meta-regression. The availability of a unified framework for meta-analysis, complemented with the implementation in a freely available and fully documented software, will provide researchers with a flexible tool for addressing nonstandard pooling problems.},
