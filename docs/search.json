However, primary studies often report multiple, statistically dependent estimates effect sizes. Dependent effect sizes can occur correlated effects structure, hierarchical effects structure, combination two (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010; James E. Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2021). correlated effects data structure typically occurs due multiple correlated measures outcome, repeated measures outcome data, comparison multiple treatment groups control group (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). hierarchical effects structure typically occurs meta-analysis includes multiple primary studies conducted researcher, lab, region (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). Researchers may inclined ignore dependence use methods assume effect size estimate independent. However, can result inaccurate standard errors , consequently, hypothesis tests incorrect Type error rates confidence intervals incorrect coverage levels (Becker, 2000). Ad-hoc methods handling dependence include averaging effect sizes study selecting single effect size per study. methods result loss information suitable studying within-study variation effect sizes (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). method called shifting unit--analysis involves running meta-analytic models different subsets data (Cooper, 1998). However, strategy useful researcher wants summarize effects across subsets study differential effects (Becker, 2000). ideal solution handling dependence use multivariate model (Becker, 2000; Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). approach explicitly models dependence among effect sizes (Becker, 2000; Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). However, multivariate meta-analysis requires knowledge correlations covariances pairs effect size estimates within study, often difficult obtain primary studies. handle dependence without knowing covariance structure effect size estimates, Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson (2010) proposed use robust variance estimation (RVE). RVE involves estimating variances meta-regression model’s coefficients using sandwich estimators valid even covariance structure unknown mis-specified (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). However, performance characteristics RVE asymptotic large number clusters studies required provide accurate standard error estimates (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). number studies meta-analysis small, RVE, originally proposed Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson (2010), can result downwardly biased standard errors inflation Type error rates (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010; Tipton, 2015). Tipton (2015) Tipton & Pustejovsky (2015) examined several small sample correction methods improve performance RVE. Tipton (2015) recommended CR2 type correction RVE well use Satterthwaite degrees freedom single coefficient tests. Tipton & Pustejovsky (2015) examined corrections multiple-contrast hypothesis tests. Tipton & Pustejovsky (2015) found HTZ test, extension CR2 correction method Satterthwaite degrees freedom, controlled Type 1 error rate adequately even number studies small. However, Joshi, Pustejovsky, & Beretvas (2021) showed, simulations, HTZ test can conservative. authors examined another method, cluster wild bootstrapping (CWB), studied econometrics literature meta-analytic context. results simulations Joshi, Pustejovsky, & Beretvas (2021) showed CWB adequately controlled Type 1 error rate provided higher power HTZ test, especially multiple-contrast hypothesis tests.","code":""},{"path":"https://meghapsimatrix.github.io/wildmeta/articles/cwbmeta.html","id":"bootstrapping","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Bootstrapping","title":"Cluster Wild Bootstrapping for Meta-Analysis","text":"General bootstrapping can used estimate measures uncertainty, like standard errors, p-values confidence intervals, even methods fail (Boos & others, 2003).
